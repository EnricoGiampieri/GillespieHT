Gillespie Algo High Throughput MPI application

https://github.com/EricPasc/GillespieHT/

This software take in input a Biological linear system of reaction described to json file.
If you use MPI you can compute more system in parallel because this is High Throughput application.

COMPILATION
-----------

Requirements: Compiler C (icc preferred), Intel MKL library, MPI Software Stack

The software is compiled through Makefile.

In make file you must change the flag -DVECTOR_SIZE=$YOUR_SIZE, where $YOUR_SIZE is the size 
with which the arrays are aligned. The another flag you must change depending to your architecture
is MKL flags: -DMKL_ILP64.

For found correct MKL flags, you can use IntelÂ® Math Kernel Library Link Line Advisor:
